CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Diego Acosta and Eylul Akgul
Escape Keck game project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  The description is at high enough level to
   give the reader an overview, and yet low enough level to let the reader
   know what some of the planned technologies are that you are using, and
   what they will be used for.

   The justification section is also well done, specifying the MVP focus
   for the initial project goal as well as anecdotal evidence that others
   think it's an interesting idea.  Your self-reflection is evident in the
   way you express that the project is a 'stretch' and you still have much
   to learn.  One thing to add, to which you allude in the text, is the
   NAMES of the IGI minors who are part of your group ~ make sure not to
   leave them out when giving credit, and be sure to also specify what parts
   of the project they contribute to.

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  The slides look great, your justification
   of both the project goals and the applicability to the course are well-
   thought-out and clear.  This will be a fun project!  I like that you have
   'subcontracted' some of the work to non-CS people, giving you experience
   with a multi-disciplined team.  The slides are very macabre and quite
   imaginative, and you handled the questions well.

your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
