Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.  Your answers to the 'thought problems' are
nicely detailed without being overly verbose.

I'm not sure about the "event driven" architecture for tic-tac-toe.  I'd
be interested to know your thinking on that, since it isn't responding to
inputs other than simple user input in a turn-based way...

Good job on the drawings, too!

Excellent work ~ keep it up!
