Nice work!

problem 4.2 you have the correct duration, but there is one operation that's
   missing ~ should be G -> D -> E -> M -> Q since you can't get from E to Q
   without going through M...

problem 4.4 you got the durations correct but the dates in your chart aren't
   correct.  The problem said to start on WEDNESDAY January 1st, you have it
   as Monday.  Also, you were supposed to skip the holidays listed in the
   table which you don't have included [except for New Year's].  Developers
   will NOT be happy...

problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty

problem 5.9 good thinking on this one!  You came up with some good things to
   pay attention to.

Good job!!
