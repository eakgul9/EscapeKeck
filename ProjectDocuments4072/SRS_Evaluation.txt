Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------

Nice job on the introduction section!  This is exactly the correct level of
   detail for this section of the document.

-- Functional Requirements
   Your functional requirements section is VERY very light.  You need many
   more requirements here.  For example, you have:

   2.1.1 The character controller shall be a top-down point-and-click

   First, what does "top-down" mean?  Second, "point-and-click" at what?

   Third, point with what?  If using the mouse that should be specified.
   If using the touchpad, that should be specified.  If both, THAT should
   be specified.  Those are *separate requirements statements*.  Fourth,
   what is the user clicking ON?  Is it something in the background?  Is
   it a picture of an item in the lab?  If it's an item, what item will
   it be?  If there are multiple items, there should be a shall that says
   there are multiple items, and a corresponding 'will' statement that
   gives a sample list of them.  If the player clicks on an item, how close
   does the character need to be for the click to register?  If it's not
   close enough to interact with the object, will the game present an error
   message to the player to let them know?

   Fifth, the player clicks a position and the character moves.  Is moving
   instantaneous or does the character appear to walk over?  Is the speed of
   movement controllable?  Is there a 'run' selection?  How is a click for
   movement differentiated from a click to pick up an object?

   Sixth, examining an object, rotating it, picking it up, etc., how are
   these things accomplished?

   Seventh, how are the transitions from room to room done?  Are there doors
   from the lab to the annex as in RL?  Will the elevator to the lower level
   be animated or will it be a 'teleporting' action?

   I think you see by now that there are quite a few more requirements that
   are needed here to FULLY specify what your plan is for the game.

-- Performance Requirements
   Your performance requirements are also a bit light, even though it's okay
   for there to be fewer requirements in this section than the functional
   section.

   You say "most game interactions" should be instantaneous.  Which of these
   interactions are NOT instantaneous?  What are the specifications for the
   interactions ~ 1 second or 2 seconds or user is notified or what?  You'll
   need more here....

-- Environment Requirements
   Good work here, although, it would help to know if these are 'minimum' or
   'typical' requirements.  Another thing to consider is, there will be some
   differences between the hardware/software used for DEVELOPING the game and
   that needed to RUN the game.

=============================================================================
your score:  7.5% out of 10% which is a C

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.
Make the changes as suggested above, including many more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.

=============================================================================
SECOND EVALUATION:

your score:  9.5% out of 10% which is an A

You have done a good job of expanding on your requirements!  There are quite
a few more and they are all very well-stated.  Also, it looks like you added
some 'will' statements to your requirements, which is good to help explain
what each 'shall' statement is about.  For your Environment and Performance
requirements, those seem fine.  Your Functional requirements are better, but
still a little light, but you addressed the comments!
